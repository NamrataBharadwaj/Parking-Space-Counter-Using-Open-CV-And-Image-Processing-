# Parking-Space-Counter-Using-Open-CV-And-Image-Processing-
An image-processing-based smart parking system created for multistory parking garages, open parking lots, and more is presented in this study. The proposed system architecture determines if a parking spot in the received video is occupied or not by combining edge detection and coordinate bound pixel sections.
